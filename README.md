## 🌸 Overview

The CycleVault is a **privacy-first menstrual cycle tracking app** designed around a single principle:

> **Your reproductive health data should remain fully under your control.**

Unlike most health apps, The CycleVault does not require accounts, does not sync data to the cloud, and does not rely on analytics or advertising SDKs. All core functionality works entirely offline, with data stored locally on your device and protected by iOS security mechanisms.

The project intentionally prioritizes **clarity, restraint, and trust** over optimization, gamification, or behavioral tracking.

---

## 🎨 Core Philosophy

The CycleVault is built with a small set of non-negotiable values:

- **Local-first by default**  
  All cycle data stays on your device. Nothing is uploaded automatically.

- **Explicit user control**  
  Any external connection only happens when a user deliberately chooses it.

- **No monetization through data**  
  No ads, no analytics SDKs, no silent telemetry.

- **Clarity over prediction**  
  The app emphasizes awareness and patterns, not guarantees or “cycle hacking.”

- **Calm, human-centered design**  
  The interface and content are intentionally gentle, neutral, and non-alarmist.

The visual language (warm coral, soft lavender, minimal contrast) reflects this philosophy: approachable, steady, and respectful.

## 🌙 What the App Does

The CycleVault allows users to:

- Log period start and end dates
- Track flow intensity, symptoms, and notes
- View cycles on a calendar and in history
- See estimated cycle phases and patterns
- Export or fully delete all data at any time
- Lock the app using Face ID / Touch ID (optional)
- Read menstrual health education written in plain English

All features are designed to work **without creating an account** and **without sharing personal information**.

---

## 📚 Education Library

The app includes a built-in Education Library with two clearly separated sources:

### CycleVault Education
Plain-English articles written by The CycleVault that explain menstrual health concepts, variability, and lived experience in a calm, non-medical tone.

### Medical References
Carefully selected external resources from reputable public health organizations, hospitals, and research institutions.

Educational content opens in an in-app browser and is never personalized or tracked.

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Transparency

Privacy is a product feature, not a promise.

The CycleVault intentionally avoids:
- Analytics SDKs
- Crash reporting tied to identity
- Background network activity
- Third-party data collection libraries

A built-in **Privacy Dashboard** allows users to see:
- What data exists on their device
- How much data is stored
- When the app last made an external connection (if ever)

This transparency is designed to be observable, not assumed.

---

## 🧱 Project Structure

This repository contains:

- The iOS application codebase (Swift / SwiftUI)
- Local data models and services
- Education content and supporting website assets
- Supporting documentation and tooling

The project favors explicit, readable architecture over abstraction-heavy patterns.

---

## 🚫 Non-Goals

The CycleVault intentionally does **not** aim to:

- Diagnose medical conditions
- Replace professional medical advice
- Optimize fertility or hormones
- Perform behavioral tracking
- Build centralized user profiles

It is a tool for **awareness**, not control.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The CycleVault provides educational information and tracking tools only.  
It does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

If you have concerns about your health, consider speaking with a qualified healthcare professional.
